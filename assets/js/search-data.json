            "content": "Translating a product requirement into a classification metric is critical to evaluate a model. In this article we will be going through a single number evaluation metric. Before we dive into metrics we need to understand confusion matrix aka Error Matrix. This is a table that allows us to vizualize the classifications of a model. From this confusion matrix we can derive multiple evaulation model metrics. . Lets start with a funny example where the AI model got confused between a football and refree&#39;s bald head. To keep things simple we are planning to improve the model by adding in a binary classifier. We input multiple pictures of ball and head. Our aim is to evaulate the new model&#39;s performance. . We are testing the new model on a set of 60 pictures, 40 of them ball while the rest 20 head. The model has classified 50 images as ball and 10 as head. After manual investigation of the model output, we find that out of 50 classified as balls, 18 of them are heads while out of the 10 classified heads 8 of them are balls. Visualizing the above infomration would be easy. . import seaborn as sns from mlxtend.plotting import plot_confusion_matrix import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import numpy as np . confusionMat = np.array([[32, 2], [18, 8]]) fig, ax = plot_confusion_matrix(conf_mat=confusionMat) plt.show() .",

            "content": "Example Markdown Post . Basic setup . Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format: . YEAR-MONTH-DAY-filename.md . Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting . You can use italics, bold, code font text, and create links. Here’s a footnote 1. Here’s a horizontal rule: . . Lists . Here’s a list: . item 1 | item 2 | . And a numbered list: . item 1 | item 2 | Boxes and stuff . This is a quotation . . You can include alert boxes …and… . . You can include info boxes Images . . Code . You can format text and code per usual . General preformatted text: . # Do a thing do_thing() . Python code and output: . # Prints &#39;2&#39; print(1+1) . 2 .
